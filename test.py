TODO: 
- for testing the actual web scraping we just call the scrap_exhibitions function, making sure it works and Pydantic validates the data
    - no need to check the content of scrapped stuff, because parsing is tested by other tests with static test data

- testing parse_entry
  - download some HTML pages from the artmmuseum website, strip out scripts
  - write your own HTML entries with edge cases, using their template (perhaps make a function for generating them)
